Module to handle reverse charge IVA in vendor bills.

The module allows you to automate the accounting entries derived from invoices of intra-EU and extra-EU suppliers through the VAT reverse charge.
Furthermore, the vendor bill cancellation and reopening procedure is automated.

It is also possible to use the "additional vendor self billing" mode.
This mode is typically used for non-EU suppliers to show, in the purchases VAT journal, a vendor bill addressed to your own company (self-bill).
The self-bill will then be completely reconciled with the self-invoice, which is also addressed to your own company.
